## How to cook cookies
Here is a simple recipe for chocolate chip cookies that you can try:

  Ingredients:
2 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

  Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
In a separate large mixing bowl, beat the butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until creamy.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Gradually mix in the flour mixture.
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Leave about 2 inches of space between each cookie.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy!
