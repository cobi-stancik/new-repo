## How to cook cookies
Here is a simple recipe for chocolate chip cookies that you can try:

  Ingredients:
  
- 2 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 tsp baking soda

- 1 tsp salt

- 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature

- 3/4 cup white sugar

- 3/4 cup brown sugar

- 2 tsp vanilla extract

- 2 large eggs

- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

3. In a separate large mixing bowl, beat the butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until creamy.

4. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. 

5. Gradually mix in the flour mixture.

6. Stir in the chocolate chips.

7. Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. 

8. Leave about 2 inches of space between each cookie.

9. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.

10. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy!
